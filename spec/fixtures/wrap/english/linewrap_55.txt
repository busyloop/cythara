When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four d
ifferent people, no one of whom really owns it, it will
 end up being like a common-room. It will tend to feel 
bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The right wa
y to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into s
harply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and
 with interfaces between them that are as carefully des
igned and, if possible, as articulated as programming l
anguages. 1234567890_ABCDEFGHI_1234567890_ABCDEFGHI_123
