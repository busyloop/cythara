When a piece of code 
is being hacked by th
ree or four different
 people, no one of wh
om really owns it, it
 will end up being li
ke a common-room. It 
will tend to feel ble
ak and abandoned, and
 accumulate cruft. Th
e right way to collab
orate, I think, is to
 divide projects into
 sharply defined modu
les, each with a defi
nite owner, and with 
interfaces between th
em that are as carefu
lly designed and, if 
possible, as articula
ted as programming la
nguages. 1234567890_A
