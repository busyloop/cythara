When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four··
different people, no one of whom really owns it, it····
will end up being like a common-room. It will tend to··
feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The····
right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide········
projects into sharply defined modules, each with a·····
definite owner, and with interfaces between them that··
are as carefully designed and, if possible, as·········
articulated as programming languages.··················
