When a piece 
of code is be
ing hacked by
 three or fou
r different p
eople, no one
 of whom real
ly owns it, i
t will end up
 being like a
 common-room.
 It will tend
 to feel blea
k and abandon
ed, and accum
ulate cruft. 
The right way
 to collabora
te, I think, 
is to divide 
projects into
 sharply defi
ned modules, 
each with a d
efinite owner
, and with in
terfaces betw
een them that
 are as caref
ully designed
 and, if poss
ible, as arti
culated as pr
ogramming lan
guages. 12345
