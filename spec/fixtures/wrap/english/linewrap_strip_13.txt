When a piece 
of code is be
ing hacked by
three or four
different peo
ple, no one o
f whom really
owns it, it w
ill end up be
ing like a co
mmon-room. It
will tend to 
feel bleak an
d abandoned, 
and accumulat
e cruft. The 
right way to 
collaborate, 
I think, is t
o divide proj
ects into sha
rply defined 
modules, each
with a defini
te owner, and
with interfac
es between th
em that are a
s carefully d
esigned and, 
if possible, 
as articulate
d as programm
ing languages
