When a p

code is 
being ha

three or
four dif

whom rea

it, it w
ill end 
up being
like a c
ommon-ro
om. It w
ill tend
to feel 
bleak an
d abando

accumula
te cruft
. The ri
ght way 
to colla
borate, 
I think,
is to di
vide pro
jects in
to sharp
ly defin
ed modul
es, each
with a d
efinite 
owner, a
nd with 
interfac
es betwe
en them 
that are
as caref
ully des

ssible, 
as artic
