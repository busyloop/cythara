When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four d
ifferent people, no one of whom really owns it, it will
end up being like a common-room. It will tend to feel b
leak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The right way
to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sha
rply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and w
ith interfaces between them that are as carefully desig
ned and, if possible, as articulated as programming lan
guages. 1234567890_ABCDEFGHI_1234567890_ABCDEFGHI_12345
